displays window with a black screen 

Game Loop:
  - updates game 25 times a seconed
  - redners to screen as fast a possible

basic eneity structure

basic templated doubly linked list

## Goals
  - get draw implemented by june 20th
  - get a player on screen by jine 20th
    - with image (optional)
  - get a simple physics engine by end of june

## To-Do:
  - implement eneity classes 
  - implement draw classes
  - add physics 
  - add a test world (procedural?)
